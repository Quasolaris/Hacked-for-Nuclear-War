DEEP OCEAN VESSEL — INTEGRATED SYSTEM OVERVIEW
(SCS-CENTRIC CONFIGURATION)
SIMULATION / FICTIONAL PLATFORM
-----------------------------------------------------------------
```

## 1. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The vessel is organized around a centralized command computer known as the **Submarine Command System (SCS)**. All major subsystems either report to or receive authorization from the SCS.

## 2. CYBER ATTACK ENTRY POINTS (IN-UNIVERSE)

In the game’s fiction, hostile code may be introduced through:

* Compromised removable data modules
* Corrupted maintenance diagnostics
* Contaminated update media
* Insider action during resupply or overhaul

Once introduced, malicious logic **does not immediately reveal itself**. Instead, it degrades system trust over time.

---

## 3. SYSTEM-WIDE IMPACT OF A SUCCESSFUL ATTACK

### 3.1 Command Core (SCS)

**Primary Effect:**
Loss of system authority and decision integrity.

**Observed Symptoms:**

* Inconsistent command acknowledgment
* Spurious fault warnings
* Delayed or missing system responses

**Operational Impact:**
The vessel effectively loses its ability to act as a coordinated platform. All other subsystems begin operating in isolation or fail-safe modes.

---

### 3.2 Navigation & Positioning

**Primary Effect:**
Data trust collapse.

**Observed Symptoms:**

* Position drift without external confirmation
* Conflicting depth and attitude readings
* Frozen or oscillating indicators

**Operational Impact:**

* Vessel cannot reliably determine location
* Maneuvering becomes hazardous
* Command decisions lose situational validity

---

### 3.3 Propulsion & Control

**Primary Effect:**
Command gating failure.

**Observed Symptoms:**

* Delayed throttle response
* Control surface hesitation
* Automatic limitation overrides

**Operational Impact:**

* Reduced maneuverability
* Inability to execute precise depth or course changes
* Emergency actions may be unavailable

---

### 3.4 Sensor Suite (Passive Systems)

**Primary Effect:**
Signal interpretation degradation.

**Observed Symptoms:**

* Contact classification errors
* Phantom detections
* Loss of signal correlation

**Operational Impact:**

* Crew cannot trust environmental awareness
* Tactical decision-making compromised
* Increased risk of collision or detection

---

### 3.5 Communications (Internal & External)

**Primary Effect:**
Synchronization failure.

**Observed Symptoms:**

* Garbled internal messages
* Delayed or dropped command relays
* External communication lockout

**Operational Impact:**

* Crew coordination breaks down
* External command authority cannot be verified
* Isolation increases stress and error rates

---

### 3.6 Power Management

**Primary Effect:**
Load distribution instability.

**Observed Symptoms:**

* Unexpected subsystem shutdowns
* Power spikes or brownouts
* Protective interlocks triggering without cause

**Operational Impact:**

* Cascading subsystem failures
* Increased likelihood of total system blackout

---

### 3.7 Life Support Monitoring

**Primary Effect:**
Data integrity loss (monitoring only).

**Observed Symptoms:**

* Conflicting environmental readings
* False alarms or missing alerts

**Operational Impact:**

* Crew forced to rely on manual checks
* Elevated fatigue and risk
* Morale degradation

---

## 4. CASCADING FAILURE SCENARIO (NARRATIVE FLOW)

1. **Initial Intrusion**
   No immediate symptoms. System operates nominally.

2. **Trust Erosion Phase**
   Minor warnings appear. Crew attributes issues to equipment age.

3. **Command Desynchronization**
   SCS begins issuing contradictory or delayed directives.

4. **Subsystem Isolation**
   Safety logic forces independent operation.

5. **Catastrophic Fault**
   SCS enters terminal failure state (see fault codes).

6. **Operational Outcome**
   Vessel becomes mission-incapable without external assistance.

---

## 5. STRATEGIC CONSEQUENCES (IN-GAME)

* Mission failure without obvious external damage
* Crew uncertainty and mistrust of instruments
* Difficulty proving hostile action occurred
* Long-term removal of vessel from service
