# Submarine Command System (SCS)

## CATASTROPHIC FAULT CODE MANUAL

**Document Number:** SCS-TM-9-6110-F
**Revision:** 5.2
**Distribution:** RESTRICTED 

### Overview

The **Submarine Command System (SCS)** is a hardened, real-time computer used to control nuclear submarine systems. It is responsible for navigation, reactor control, weapons control and communication.

## 1. PURPOSE OF DOCUMENT

This document defines **catastrophic fault codes** generated by the **Submarine Command System (SCS)**. These faults represent **terminal system failures** resulting in immediate loss of computational capability. Upon issuance, **no operator action can restore functionality** without full system reinitialization or authorized maintenance procedures.

All fault codes conform to the following format:

```
0xXXXXXXXXXX
```

## 2. FAULT CODE INTERPRETATION

| Field       | Description            |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `0x`        | Hexadecimal designator |
| Digits 1–2  | Failure class          |
| Digits 3–6  | Affected subsystem     |
| Digits 7–10 | Failure signature      |

## 3. CATASTROPHIC FAULT CODES

### 0xA1F0C0FFEE

**Failure Class:** A1 – Memory Integrity Failure
**Subsystem:** Core Memory Controller

**Condition:**
Non-recoverable corruption detected within volatile memory space. Address boundaries violated. Data coherence lost.

**Result:**

* Immediate processor halt
* Loss of all volatile data
* Display freeze or signal dropout

**Operator Action:**
None. System is non-responsive.

---

### 0xB2DEADBEEF

**Failure Class:** B2 – Kernel Control Failure
**Subsystem:** Real-Time Task Scheduler

**Condition:**
Scheduler entered undefined execution state following conflicting interrupt vectors. Task arbitration failed.

**Result:**

* Command queue collapse
* Input ignored
* Hard system lock

**Operator Action:**
None. Await system timeout or power loss.

---

### 0xC300MBR404

**Failure Class:** C3 – Boot Structure Failure
**Subsystem:** Boot Record Emulator

**Condition:**
Boot record table unreadable or invalid. No viable startup partition detected.

**Result:**

* Reboot cycle initiated
* Reboot cycle fails
* System remains offline

**Operator Action:**
None. Maintenance authority required.

---

### 0xD4STACK0VER

**Failure Class:** D4 – Execution Stack Failure
**Subsystem:** Command Processing Unit

**Condition:**
Stack depth exceeded safe limits. Return address overwritten.

**Result:**

* Sudden system shutdown
* Active operations terminated
* Session data unrecoverable

**Operator Action:**
None.

---

### 0xE5FIRMWAREX

**Failure Class:** E5 – Firmware Integrity Failure
**Subsystem:** Control ROM

**Condition:**
Firmware image checksum mismatch. Integrity verification failed.

**Result:**

* Transition to permanent fault state
* Restricted diagnostics only
* All command functions disabled

**Operator Action:**
Do not attempt restart.

---

### 0xF600NULLPTR

**Failure Class:** F6 – Logic Execution Failure
**Subsystem:** Tactical Logic Simulator

**Condition:**
Critical logic routine attempted invalid memory reference. Exception handling failed to engage.

**Result:**

* Immediate system crash
* Loss of display and audio output
* Power cycle required

**Operator Action:**
None.

---

## 4. GENERAL WARNINGS

* Catastrophic fault codes indicate **irreversible system failure**.
* Continued operation after fault detection is **not possible**.
* Unauthorized restart attempts may result in **additional system damage**.
* These faults may be **induced by combat damage, environmental stress, or internal sabotage**.

---

## 5. TRAINING NOTE (SIMULATION)

In simulation environments, catastrophic faults may be used to:

* Enforce mission failure conditions
* Limit operator response time
* Increase operational stress realism
